I remember I was playing a game with my 9-year-old son John Leslie and I beat him 10 straight games in a game called Connect Four and finally I said John less now I'm bored I don't want to play you anymore and I got up I said I'm ready to go to sleep now John Leslie said no you can't go now Dad I said why he said it's not over until I win that was his attitude we sat down and we played several other games and finally after the 11th game John Leslie won and he got up and he young and he said I'm ready to go to sleep now and I'm saying to you what if all of us took that attitude and no one shows up or somebody say you can count on me and they don't come through what if we have that kind of attitude possessed nobody believes in you you've lost again and again and again the lights are cut off but you still looking at your dream reviewing it everyday and say to yourself it's not over until I win it's very important as you hold on to that dream the moments when you're going to doubt yourself they're rough times are going to come but they have not come to stay they have come to pass it's very important you to know that don't say I'm having a bad day Sam having a character building day

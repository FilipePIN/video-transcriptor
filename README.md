# video-transcriptor

**A simple implementation of google Speech-to-Text models in video transcription.**

*How to use:*

> To use this transcriptor, just paste your videos on 'videos' folder and run the trascript.py file. 

> The code works for videos in mp4 format. You can change the file extension in the code to work with other video formats.

> Google API has trained models for many other languages, not just en-US. To transcribe videos in other languages, just specify this in the code, changing language='en-US' to another one, like language='pt-BR'.
